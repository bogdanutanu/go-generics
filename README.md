Tutorial: [https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/generics]

What are generics? It's a style of programming where functions and other structures are written in a way which allows for specific types to be specified later. An example are data structures such as lists, where thanks to generics we can provide the specific type of elements the list will contain at the time we instantiate (create) the list.

In Go genercis have only been introduced as part of the 1.18 release.
